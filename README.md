# workday-scheduler

## Process:

Using the initial code provided, we must build a daily calendar that organises each event by time.

- A repository was created in GitHub and cloned to my device.
- Click on the link below to acess the webpage

## Usage:

* When the application is opened, it should be a varied colour depending on the time. 
* Green represents the future, grey represents the past, and red represents the present.
* when the page is refreshed, everything written should stay the same.


## Image:

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
